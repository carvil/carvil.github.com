The [16th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=16)
of the project Euler site was fairly easy to solve. With a one-line function,
I am able to calculate the sum of the digits ofÂ 2^x, for a given x as
input: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char 
    
    sumF = sum . map digitToInt . show . (^) 2 
{% endhighlight %}
    
Then, it was just a matter of calling the function with 1000 as input. The execution was
really fast, so ghci presented (0.00 secs, 0 bytes).
