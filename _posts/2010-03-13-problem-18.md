In order to solve the [18th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=18), I used a
lookahead function that tries to find out which position to choose in the
current level of the triangle based on the next level. It also uses the last
position used in order to pick the right values in the next levels of the
triangle. First, I defined both triangles using a list of lists, as one can
see below.

{% highlight haskell %}
    import List

    type Triag = [[Int]]

    triangle :: Triag
    triangle =
     [
      [75],
      [95,64],
      [17,47,82],
      [18,35,87,10],
      [20,04,82,47,65],
      [19,01,23,75,03,34],
      [88,02,77,73,07,63,67],
      [99,65,04,28,06,16,70,92],
      [41,41,26,56,83,40,80,70,33],
      [41,48,72,33,47,32,37,16,94,29],
      [53,71,44,65,25,43,91,52,97,51,14],
      [70,11,33,28,77,73,17,78,39,68,17,57],
      [91,71,52,38,17,14,91,43,58,50,27,29,48],
      [63,66,04,68,89,53,67,30,73,16,69,87,40,31],
      [04,62,98,27,23,09,70,98,73,93,38,53,60,04,23]
     ]

    triangleExample :: Triag
    triangleExample =
      [
       [3],
       [7,4],
       [2,4,6],
       [8,5,9,3]
      ]
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I created a few utility functions that I thought I could use, such as
maxValue, which returns the position of the best number among 2; the
indexOf, which btw I am not very proud of, that returns the position of a
given number in a list (note: although one should never define such a function
like that, I am sure I will find an element in that list, so the result will
always be correct); and finally maxOf, which tells the lookahead
function which position it should return based on the next level of the
triangle. Here are the definitions:

{% highlight haskell %}
    maxValue ::
      Int   -> --position
      [Int] -> --list
      Int

    maxValue p l =
     let a = (!!) l p
         b = (!!) l (p+1)
     in case a >= b of
         True  -> p
         False -> p+1

    indexOf ::
      Int   -> --element
      [Int] -> --list
      Int      --position in the list
    indexOf n l =
    Â   case (elemIndex n l) of
       Nothing -> 0
       Just x -> x

    maxOf l = let k = unzip l
                  m = (maximum . fst) k
                  n = indexOf m (fst k)
              in (!!) (snd k) n
{% endhighlight %}

The lookahead calculates the sum of the relevant values in the current and
next level of the triangle, and returns the best position to choose:

{% highlight haskell %}
    lookahead ::
      [Int] ->  -- Line 1
      [Int] ->  -- Line 2
      Int   ->  -- Column value
      Int       -- Column position where to go next

    lookahead l1 l2 c =
      let x1_l1 = (!!) l1 c
          x2_l1 = (!!) l1 (c+1)
          v1    = (x1_l1 + (!!) l2 c,c)
          v2    = (x1_l1 + (!!) l2 (c+1),c)
          v3    = (x2_l1 + (!!) l2 (c+1),c+1)
          v4    = (x2_l1 + (!!) l2 (c+2),c+1)
          l     = [v1,v2,v3,v4]
      in maxOf l
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, it was a matter of assembling everything:

{% highlight haskell %}
    total_max ::
      Triag -> -- Triangle
      Int   -> -- Next column
      Int      -- maximum total

    total_max (l1:l2:l3:ls) n =
      let next = lookahead l2 l3 n
          val  = (!!) l1 n
      in val + total_max (l2:l3:ls) next
    total_max (l1:l2:[]) n =
      let val = (!!) l1 n
          nextval = maxValue n l2
      in val + (!!) l2 nextval

    total = total_max triangle 0
{% endhighlight %}

The interpreter returned the following output, when I executed the _total_
function: (0.03 secs, 4125124 bytes) Although it is not a pretty solution, it
solved the problem relatively fast. Now I will try it in [problem 67](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=67), where there are
299 possible routes!
