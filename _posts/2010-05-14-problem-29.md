Here is my solution for the [29th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=29):

{% highlight haskell %}
    import List
    
    f = length $ nub [a^b | a <- [2..100], 
                            b <-[2..100]]
    
    main = print f
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks to Haskell, it was relatively easy to solve. GHC's execution time was:

real 0m0.650s
user 0m0.646s
sys 0m0.003s
