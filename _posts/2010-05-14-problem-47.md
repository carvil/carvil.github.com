Instead of building yet another function to calculate prime factors and
sieves, I used an existing package: [NumberTheory.Sieve.Factor](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/NumberSieves/0.0/doc/html/NumberTheory-Sieve-Factor.html) to solve the [47th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=47):

{% highlight haskell %}
    import NumberTheory.Sieve.Factor
    
    f l x = let l1 = zip l (map (length . factor (sieve x)) l)
                l2 = filter ((==) 4 . snd) l1
                l3 = consec l2
            in l3
      where consec (x1:x2:x3:x4:xs) =
              case (fst x4) _-_ (fst x1) == 3 of
                True  -> [x1,x2,x3,x4]
                False -> consec (x2:x3:x4:xs)
            consec _ = []
    
    main = print $ f [1..999999] 9999999
{% endhighlight %}

The functionÂ f calculates a list of pairs containing a number and the number
of its prime factors, and filters all numbers that do not have 4 prime
factors. Then it is a matter of calling the consec function, that returns
the first 4 consecutive integers that have exactly 4 prime factors. The
program executes in (0.38 secs, 143730392 bytes).
