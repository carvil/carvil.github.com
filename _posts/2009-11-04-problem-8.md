The [8th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=8) in
the Project Euler website didn't offer a lot of resistance. I started by
defining the 1000-digit number in Haskell, naming it n. So, I had something
like: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char 
    import List 
    
    n :: Integer 
    n = 73167176531 ... 52963450 
{% endhighlight %}
    
(I didn't see the point of writing the entire number here, since it is very big).
Afterwards, it was a matter of defining this simple function: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    f :: Integer -> Int 
    f = head . reverse . sort . g . map digitToInt . show 
{% endhighlight %}
    
Where g is defined as: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    g (x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:xs) = x1*x2*x3*x4*x5 : g (x2:x3:x4:x5:xs) 
    g _ = []
{% endhighlight %}
    
One could argue that it could be more efficient, however my ghci calculates the following execution time: (0.03
secs, 1834872 bytes)
