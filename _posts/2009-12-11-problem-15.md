When I first saw problem [15](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=15) in the project
Euler site, I immediately remembered my math classes at the University. So, I
used pen and paper to specify the solution by means of combinations. So, since
the grid is 20 by 20, we would have the following binomial coefficient: 

    C(n,k) = C(40,20) = 40! / ( 20! (40-20)! ) = 40! / (20! 20!) 
    
Then it was a matter of using Haskell ghci to calculate the factorial of 40 and 20 and finish the
calculations.
