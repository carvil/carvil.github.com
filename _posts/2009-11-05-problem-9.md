In this post I will show how did I solve the [9th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=9) of the Euler
project. This was one of the first problems that gave me performance issues
and therefore a brute force approach was not good enough. However, I just
realised that after building a brute force algorithm :-) I started describing
all the conditions stated in the description of the problem. Therefore, I got
this Haskell function: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    l = [ [a,b,c] | a <- [1..999], 
                    b <- [1..999], 
                    c <- [1..999], 
                    a+b+c== 1000 && a^2 + b^2 == c^2 && a < b && b < c] 
{% endhighlight %}
    
Then, with a simple function called value:

{% highlight haskell %}
    value = product . head 
{% endhighlight %}
    
By executing value l, I reached the following result:Â (371.90 secs, 32855979636 bytes) As one can
see, it is not an interesting result for such a problem. I was just making too
many combinations of a, b and c, and most of the conditions were
unnecessary. From the problem description, it is possible to deduct that c
can be written by means of a and b. Using this simple substitution and
removing the unnecessary conditions, I reached this solution: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    h = [[a,b,1000-a-b] | a <- [1..999], b <- [1..999],a^2 + b^2 == (1000-a-b)^2]
{% endhighlight %}
    
After running value h, this was the result: (0.79 secs, 108452856 bytes), which is
much better than the first one.
