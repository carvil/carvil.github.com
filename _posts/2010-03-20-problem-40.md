The [40th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=40)
of the project Euler can be solved by taking advantage of the Haskell
laziness. As one can see below, I defined an infinite list _inf_lst_, which
contains all positive integers in a string format. As I said, since Haskell is
lazy, it will only compute the list if it needs its values. Therefore, it was
only a matter of accessing the 6 required positions in the list and calculate
its multiplication:

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char

    f = foldr ((*) . digitToInt) 1 l
      where l       = map ((!!) inf_lst) [10^i | 
                                        i <- [1..6]]
            inf_lst = concat [show i | i <- [0..] ]
{% endhighlight %}

The execution time is: (0.32 secs, 69247988 bytes)
