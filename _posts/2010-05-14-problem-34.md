The solution for [this](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=34) problem is
somewhat similar to the 30th problem, as it involves the construction of a
list based on the problem rules:

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char
    
    f = sum [x | x <- [3..50000], x == g x]
      where g = sum . 
                map (factorial . digitToInt) . 
                show
            factorial n = foldl (*) 1 [1..n]
    
    main = print f
{% endhighlight %}

Again, the execution was quite fast:

real 0m0.059s
user 0m0.056s
sys 0m0.003s

However, I started with going until 10^6, since I din't know how many numbers
would satisfy the condition. In fact, there are only two, so I could therefore
reduce the search domain considerably.
