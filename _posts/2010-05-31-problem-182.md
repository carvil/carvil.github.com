The [182nd Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=182) was
definitely very interesting to solve. At first, the problem description looks
very complicated and with a lot of information. But after some reading I was
able to disregard some of the information. I will try to put my line of
thoughts into words. The RSA encryption is base on the following procedure:

  - Generate two distinct primes p and q.
  - Compute n = p q and phi = (p-1) (q-1).
  - Find an integer e, 1 < e < phi, such that gcd(e,phi) = 1.

The e is used to encrypt a message. So, for a message m, we need to
calculate c = me mod n. However, some messages are unconcealed, i.e. there
exist messages m such that me mod n = m. The problem aims to find the sum of
all values of e, 1 < e < phi (1009,3643) and gcp(e,phi) = 1 so that the
number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum. As a starting point, phi is
easily calculated:

{% highlight haskell %}
    phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
{% endhighlight %}

In the same way, the problem description describes the range of values in
which one should pick e:

{% highlight haskell %}
    e <- [2..phi-1]
{% endhighlight %}

Until now it is easy. The big issue is how to find out how to make sure that
the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum. After some reading, I
found out that the number of unconcealed messages is given by:

{% highlight haskell %}
    (1 + gcd (e-1) (p-1)) * (1 + gcd (e-1) (q-1))
{% endhighlight %}

Furthermore, it is also true (page 290 of [Handbook of applied cryptography](http://books.google.dk/books?id=nSzoG72E93MC&lpg=PA313&ots=MuFhy6uHfL&dq=minimum%20number%20unconcealed%20messages%20RSA&pg=PA290#v=onepage&q=unconcealed&f=false)) that since e-1, p-1 and q-1 are all even, the number of
unconcealed messages is always at least 9. So if we want to make sure that we
sum the values of e so that the number of unconcealed messages are at a minimum:

{% highlight haskell %}
    (1 + gcd (e-1) (p-1)) * (1 + gcd (e-1) (q-1)) == 9
{% endhighlight %}

From this formula we can derive that in order to have 9 as a result:

{% highlight haskell %}
    (gcd (e-1) (p-1)) +1 == 3
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight haskell %}
    (gcd (e-1) (q-1)) +1 == 3
{% endhighlight %}

Since now we have all the pieces of the puzzle, here is the complete solution:

{% highlight haskell %}
    f p q = let phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
            in sum [e | e <- [2..phi-1],
                    gcd e phi == 1,
                    (gcd (e-1) (p-1)) +1 == 3,
                    (gcd (e-1) (q-1)) +1 == 3
                   ]

    main = print $ f 1009 3643
{% endhighlight %}

The execution is also quite fast, as you can see:

real 0m2.067s
user 0m2.034s
sys 0m0.032s
