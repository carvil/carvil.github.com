In the [37th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=37), I used the
Hackage package containing the [NumberTheory.Sieve.ONeill](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/NumberSieves/0.0/doc/html/NumberTheory-Sieve-ONeill.html) library in order to have access to an efficient infinite list of
primes. Then it was a matter of manipulating lists to achieve the result.

{% highlight haskell %}
    import NumberTheory.Sieve.ONeill
    import List
    import Char
    
    myElem (x:xs) n
      | n == x = True
      | n > x  = myElem xs n
      | n < x  = False
{% endhighlight %}

The myElem function searches a specific number in a sorted list (i.e. in the
infinite prime list). Furthermore, it was a matter of defining the following
functions:
    
{% highlight haskell %}
    g :: Int -> Bool
    g n = foldr (&&) True (truncatable (show n))
    
    truncatable :: [Char] -> [Bool]
    truncatable n = map (myElem primes) (map h (delete "" (nub (inits n ++ tails n))))
      where h n = read n :: Int
    
    main = print $ sum (take 11 $ filter g (drop 4 primes))
{% endhighlight %}

The truncatable function produces a list of boolean values indicating if all
the numbers of a list are prime, while g performs the logical and over the
list. Finally, the main function produces the result with the following
execution time:

real 0m0.670s
user 0m0.662s
sys 0m0.006s
