Here I will solve the [problem 2](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=2) of the Euler
project, using Haskell. There are multiple possibilities to solve this
problem. When I first tried to solve it, I used a brute force function that
was very inefficient, so I shortly switched my approach. My first solution
used an infinite list of the fibonacci sequence, as you can see below:

{% highlight haskell %}
    fibs = 0 : 1 : [ x+y |
            (x,y) <- zip fibs (tail fibs) ]
{% endhighlight %}

Then, with a few tries in the interpreter, I discovered that I should only use the first 34 elements
of that list, since after that the numbers are greater than 4.000.000. Therefore:

{% highlight haskell %}
    l = take 34 fibs
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, I just needed to build the final function:

{% highlight haskell %}
    f = foldr (+) 0 (filter even l)
{% endhighlight %}

After this solution, I just tried another one, using the golden ration number:

{% highlight haskell %}
    goldenRatio = 1.6180339887
{% endhighlight %}

Using the golden ration number, it is possible to find the even numbers of the
fibonacci sequence (which appear in every 3 elements of the sequence).
Therefore, we calculate the number below:

{% highlight haskell %}
    v = goldenRatio ^ 3
{% endhighlight %}

If we multiply each even number of the fibonacci sequence by this number, and if we round the
result, we obtain the next even number of the sequence. Therefore, it is just
a matter of finding the even elements of the sequence:

{% highlight haskell %}
    h r = case r > 4000000
            of False -> r : h (round ((fromInteger r)*v))
               _ -> []
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, since the number 2 is the first even number of the fibonacci sequence, I just wrote a
small function to return the answer for the problem:

{% highlight haskell %}
    g = foldr (+) 0 (h 2)
{% endhighlight %}
