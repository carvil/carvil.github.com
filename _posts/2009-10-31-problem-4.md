I could see that the [problem 4](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=4) of the Euler
project could be solve with a brute force function. Since one needed to
calculate the product of two 3-digit numbers, I created two lists of all
possible 3-digit numbers, and tried all combinations. Here is my
implementation: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    import List
    
    palindrome = [ n*m | n <- [100..999], 
                         m <- [100..999], 
                         show (n*m) == 
                            reverse (show (n*m)) ] 
    
    lpal = (last . sort)
{% endhighlight %}

palindrome GHCi took about 2 seconds (and a lot of bytes!) in my computer to
figure out the result.
