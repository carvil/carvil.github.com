The [5th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=5) of
the Project Euler was the first one that gave me some work, mainly because I
started (again) by trying a brute force algorithm. Of course, I had problems
with it, starting by not getting the solution at all!! It just took too much
time to calculate it and I did not let it finish. I tried different values as
input, but it was not enough. Here is the code I used: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    f [] = 0 f (x:xs) = 
      if condition x then x else f xs 
      
    condition :: Int -> Bool 
    condition = foldr (&&) True . apply 
      where apply n = [ mod n x == 0 | x <- [1..20]] 
{% endhighlight %}
      
As you can see, I needed to give a list as input for the function f and be lucky enough
to have the correct value within that list. After a few tries, I decided to
think a bit more in the problem and searching a bit in the Haskell Prelude and
I came across with the lcm function, which allowed me to solve this problem
very efficiently: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    g = foldr lcm 1 [1..20]
{% endhighlight %}
