For the [13th problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=13) of the
Euler project, I started by defining a list containing the one hundred
numbers. So, it would be something like:

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char

    l = [37107287533902102798797998220837590246510135740250,
         46376937677490009712648124896970078050417018260538, ...
         53503534226472524250874054075591789781264330331690]
{% endhighlight %}

Then, it was a matter of defining a small function that would return the first 10 digits of the sum of
all those numbers:

{% highlight haskell %}
    sumF :: [Integer] -> [Char]
    sumF = take 10 . show . sum
{% endhighlight %}

The result (of executing sumF l) was achieved using the following timing/memory
resources: (0.01 secs, 5340404 bytes)
