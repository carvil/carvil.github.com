Again, as in the problem 29, there is not a big deal about the [30th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=30):
    
{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char
    
    f = sum [x | x <- [2..10^6], g x == x]
      where g = sum . map (^5) . map digitToInt . show
    
    main = print f
{% endhighlight %}

The execution time was:

real 0m2.494s
user 0m2.482s
sys 0m0.011s
