Thanks to the beauty of Haskell, the [97th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=97) was easy to
solve:

{% highlight haskell %}
    last10digits = non_mersenne_prime `mod` 10^10
      where non_mersenne_prime = 28433 * 2^(7830457)+1

    main = print last10digits
{% endhighlight %}

It was also quite fast (in GHCi): (0.40 secs, 29534168 bytes)
