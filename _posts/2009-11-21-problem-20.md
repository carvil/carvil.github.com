The problem [number 20](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=20) of the Euler
project aims to find the sum of the digits in the number 100!. First, I
defined the factorial function, as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Char

    fac n = foldr (*) 1 [1..n]
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I just defined a function that calculates the factorial of a
given number and performs some transformations in order to sum the digits of
that number. The function was defined as one can see below:

{% highlight haskell %}
    sumF = sum . map digitToInt . show . fac
{% endhighlight %}

Then, by executing `sumF 100`, one gets the correctresult for this problem.
