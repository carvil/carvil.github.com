When I looked to the Project Euler website, I was very excited with the
problems, so I decided to join and try to solve as much as I can. Since I
enjoy [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/) very much, I decided to try to solve
them all with it. The first problem is an easy one, in my opinion.
[Here](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=1) you can see
the problem description. Since Haskell has a powerful list type, I took
advantage of that and here it is my one-line solution for this problem: 

{% highlight haskell %}
    f = foldr (+) 0 [a | a <- [1..1000], 
            mod a 3 == 0 || mod a 5 == 0]
{% endhighlight %}
