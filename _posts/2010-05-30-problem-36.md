Below, one can find my solution to the [36th Euler problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=36):

{% highlight haskell %}
    import Numeric
    import Char
    import List
    
    f i = isPalindrome (show i) && isPalindrome (showIntAtBase 2 intToDigit i "")
      where isPalindrome l = l == reverse l
    
    main = print $ sum [i | i <- [1..10^6], f i]
{% endhighlight %}

GHC's execution time was good enough:

real 0m0.175s
user 0m0.171s
sys 0m0.003s
