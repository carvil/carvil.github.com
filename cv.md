### January 2011 - August 2011: Software Developer at Mobile Interactive Group, London

I mainly worked with Ruby technologies developing both backend RESTful APIs and frontend applications, from which I highlight: a mobile site with a RESTful Rails API to present rewards to customers of a well-known telecommunications company with backend data exchange functionality; a backend sinatra application that acts as a proxy between a number of RESTful APIs and a number of SOAP APIs from a telecommunications company.

Besides the systems mentioned above, I have been working with many other systems, mainly solving production problems as a 3rd level support and improving system's availability by fixing/enhancing the existing functionality.

### Sep 2008 – December 2010: Software Developer at Danske Bank, Denmark

Software Developer on two highly critical and highly transactional systems, namely e-banking and cards systems.

- Working with both client-side and server-side applications, developing new functionalities and improving existing functionalities in large scale, high availability banking applications to support millions of transactions per hour.
- Involved in a number of projects and tasks, completing the full development lifecycle from preliminary analysis and design to implementation and deployment within high performance teams using Scrum; experience also in pair programming.
- Conducted preliminary analysis concerning possible test automation tools that should be in place in order to improve test in general.
- Mentor for new employees.
- Developed and performed unit test, system test and integration test.

Wide range of used technologies. For client-side applications, I used Visual Studio, Javascript, HTML, CSS, XML, XSD, XSLT, among others. For server-side applications, I used a wide range of languages and tools such as Eclipse, XML, OIOUBL 2.0, RDBMS (IBM DB2, PL/SQL), Unix systems, PL/1 and MQ (messaging) among others. Finally, I work within a service-oriented architecture (SOA) using the SOAP protocol and I also use a number of tools for modelling (RSM, UML), bug tracking (Quality Center), and version control (CVS and SVN), among others.

### Oct 2007 – Apr 2008: Software Developer (part-time) at Callis ApS, Denmark

Software Developer for a startup company in Denmark, building web-based applications for integrating organisation processes with process improvement approaches such as CMMI.

- Project utilised Scrum as a working methodology and pair programming; I worked both in server-side and client-side applications.
- Technically, I used Javascript, ExtJS, HTML, XML, XSD, XSLT, CSS, version control system (SVN), bug tracking system (bugzilla), Oxygen and Eclipse among others.

### Sep 2007 – December 2010: Software Developer/Contributor/Researcher for the Overture Tool, open source community

Contributor, software developer and researcher for an open source comunnity within formal methods.

- Main goal of the group is to develop the next generation of tools to support formal modelling and analysis of highly critical computer-based systems.
- I built a proof-of-concept implementation of an application that converts two formal languages into each other, i.e. it enables the automatic conversion of VDM++ specifications into Java Modelling Language Specifications.
- Developed mainly with core Java, Eclipse IDE, Eclipse plug-ins, Eclipse RCP, maven (build manager), VDM++, VDM-SL (functional language), Java Modelling Language, ANTLR for parser generation, design patterns such as the Visitor Pattern, deep language manipulation and representation (experience with abstract syntax trees), semantic analysis, formal modelling, unit and combinatorial testing, among other topics.

Research paper presented at Formal Methods 2008, in Turku, Finland. The paper can be found [online](http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/trs/papers/1099.pdf).
